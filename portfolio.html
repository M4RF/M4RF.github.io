Challenges Faced:
	While making this game using Scratch, we faced a small amount of challenges. One of which was changing everything to suit the style of the game. Since the original game was castle themed with the OG cat sprite as the main character, we changed it to a hood themed game with a different main character. In King of the Trap, the player has to gain power, like the original game. That feature is one of the only features we left in the game. Our team changed all of the sprites, backdrops, and text bubbles in every stage of the game. So, as far as challenges go, there were only a few that included changing all of the sprites and backdrops, and making the video.</p>
	<u><h2>Ben 10 - Python Project</h2></u>
<p>You are Ben Tennyson with abilities to transform into different types of aliens. You woke up from your sleep and your grandpa has disappeared, but your cousin Gwen is there to help you find him. Both of you find a cave and see grandpa tied up behind Dr. Animo. You have a decision to either sneak around Dr. Animo or transform and battle.</p>

<p>	Using Python, Jose Naranjo and I created an interactive fiction game called Ben 10. In our interactive fiction, you play as Ben Tennyson and try to save your grandpa using your various alien transformations. The challenges we faced while making this game were: thinking of a story and fixing problems such as messing up the code.</p>
<u><h2>FINAL PROJECT: Calculator</h2></u>
<a href="https://github.com/GriffnMM/Calculator.git"><h2>Calculator</h2></a>
<p>Griffin and I created a calculator using python. The difficulties we faced included making the dropdown menu work, as far as actually saving what we put into the calculator. We ran into this problem because we used 'lambda', which we did not know how to use.</p>

<u><h2>RSA Project</h2></u>
https://github.com/JasonBet/RSA
<p>In this RSA Encryption and Decryption program that Jason Betsargon and I made, the programming language we used was Python. The purpose of our program is to encrypt and decrypt messages and to keep them unreadable until we send or recieve them. The video that I made illustrates the program being used, encrypting and decrypting messages. We faced quite a few problems and one of them was that we just didn't know how to create most of the project. However, we persevered and we finished the project.</p>
